🧠 R Language Learning Journey

Hi there 👋

Welcome to my R Programming Learning Repository!
I’ve created this repo to document my daily learning progress in R, from basic syntax to data analysis, visualization, and beyond.

Every day, I’ll be uploading the topics I study — including code examples, exercises, and projects — to track my growth and help others who are learning R too.
